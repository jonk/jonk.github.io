<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Jon and I'm a fourth year computer science major at UC Berkeley. I love anything related to programming and try to actively find new and interesting projects online. When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy skateboarding, reading books, and rock climbing. My friend and I worked to create a skate media company called Local Access Only for fun!
