Just Created a Website
========================

<p>So it seems like this thing is working. It wasn't too difficult to set up thanks to Github. I just wanna make this first post and then I can probably should get back to studying for finals. Though, they shouldn't be too bad. Its raining like a motherfucker outside, supposedly its one of the worst storms the Bay Area has seen in a long time. Last night the winds were getting pretty stormy and I thought a tree was going to fall on my room, but it ended up not being a problem. I'd like to go skateboard, but not really possible in this rain. Alas back to studying.</p>
