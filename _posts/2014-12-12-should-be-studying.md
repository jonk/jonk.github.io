excerpt: So as a little study break
---

So as a little study break, I decided to create the layout for a post page. Right now its pretty simple but now the directory is set up to easily improve it. I feel like I should probably make a topic for this blog...I can't really think of anything. Just been watching the office for a while. 

Oh! I got an idea. Texting people. Everyone above 2 and under 80 texts like it's nobodies business. Friends never call each other, unless its for something important or has to be taken care of at that exact moment. It's kind of nice, you don't have to respond to people right away and you can craft an eloquent yet simple response that gets your message across. I hardly ever even pick up my phone anymore unless I am expecting the call. Sometimes I let it go to voicemail because I would rather just text the person to communicate with them. It's ridiculous. 

Miscommunication is a regretful side effect of constant texting. In addition to missing the inflections of voice from phone communication, it is also limited by gaps in actual communication. A small conversation could take five minutes because people are not constantly staring at their phone ready to respond to a text message. When trying to schedule something, this can make it a difficult ordeal. 

Now I'm not saying that texting is bad. It's a great way to quickly communicate and exchange non-time-sensitive (<-- is that allowed?) messages. But mixing in more phone calls amidst the deluge of text messages would make communication a bit more streamlined and probably enjoyable.
