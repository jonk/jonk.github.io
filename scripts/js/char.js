One day, he was at a park in San Francisco Portrero Hill area when he saw the most beautiful blonde girl reading a book. Thorbert decided he definitely needed to jump on the aforementioned woman and profusely lick her face. So Thorbert did what he does best and trotted is way over, with his tail flopping back and worth and his tongue lazily dangled outside of his mouth, and licked that girl till her sides were sore from giggling. Thorbert and the girl became best friends and hung out all the time at the Portrero Hill park. The end!")
